Dhun is a minimalist commandline music player for OS X.

It uses Spotlight to search for audio files on your computer and play them.

## Quickstart

### Installing Dhun

Run the following commands to install Dhun. This will download the latest gem
from [http://gemcutter.org](http://gemcutter.org), compile the extensions and
put the binaries in the right place. You will need to have XCode installed for
the `gem` command to compile the native extensions.

    $ gem sources -a http://gemcutter.org
    $ gem install dhun
    
Or to install the bleeding edge, git pull from the repository and run:

    $ sudo rake gem install

For notifications, you will need [Growl](http://growl.info) installed along
with the [growlnotify](http://growl.info/documentation/growlnotify.php) tool
that comes with Growl (but needs to be installed separately).

### Starting Dhun

    $ dhun start_server
    Starting Dhun

this runs the Dhun server as a daemon by default. to not run it as a daemon:

    $ dhun start_server --foreground
or
    $ dhun start_server -f

See `dhun help start_server for more information`

### Querying for files

Dhun uses Spotlight to query for music files. Just specify a keyword, and Dhun
will look for files matching that keyword and start playing them.

You can also query the Spotlight database before playing the files, with the 
`query` command.

    $ dhun query deadmau5

    Querying: deadmau5 | 6 Results
    1 : /Volumes/Storage/Music/Grand.Theft.Auto.IV-Radio.Station.Rips-AiTB/Electro-Choc/03 One + One - No Pressure (Deadmau5 Remix).mp3
    2 : /Volumes/Storage/Music/Grand.Theft.Auto.IV-Radio.Station.Rips-AiTB/Electro-Choc/09 Chris Lake vs. Deadmau5 - I Thought Inside Out (Original Mix).mp3

    4 : Deadmau5 - Arguru (EDX's 5un5hine Remix)
    5 : Deadmau5 - Bye Friend
    6 : Deadmau5 - Clockwork

you can query based on certain filters such as artist,albums, title, genre and file.

    $ dhun query --artist="Paul van Dyk" --genre=trance --file 'Paul' --title in

    Querying: [nil] | artist:Paul van Dyk title:in genre:trance file:Paul
    3 Results
    1 : Paul van Dyk - Talk In Grey

    $ dhun query paul --title=haunted

    Querying: paul | title:haunted
    1 Results
